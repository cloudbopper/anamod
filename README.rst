Overview
--------

``anamod`` is a python library that implements model-agnostic algorithms for the feature importance analysis of trained black-box models.
It is designed to serve the larger goal of interpretable machine learning by using different abstractions over features to interpret
models. At a high level, ``anamod`` implements the following algorithms:

* Given a learned model and a hierarchy over features, (i) it tests feature groups, in addition to base features, and tries to determine
  the level of resolution at which important features can be determined, (ii) uses hypothesis testing to rigorously assess the effect of
  each feature on the model's loss, (iii) employs a hierarchical approach to control the false discovery rate when testing feature groups
  and individual base features for importance, and (iv) uses hypothesis testing to identify important interactions among features and feature
  groups. More details may be found in the following paper::

    Lee, Kyubin, Akshay Sood, and Mark Craven. 2019. “Understanding Learned Models by
    Identifying Important Features at the Right Resolution.”
    In Proceedings of the AAAI Conference on Artificial Intelligence, 33:4155–63.
    https://doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v33i01.33014155.

* Given a learned temporal or sequence model, it identifies its important features, windows as well as its dependence on temporal ordering.
  More details may be found in the following paper::

    Black-Box Models.” ArXiv:2102.11934 [Cs, Stat], February 23, 2021.

``anamod`` supersedes the library ``mihifepe``, based on the first paper
(https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/mihifepe).
``mihifepe`` is maintained for legacy reasons but will not receive further updates.

``anamod`` uses the library ``synmod`` to generate synthetic data, including time-series data, to test and validate the algorithms
(https://github.com/cloudbopper/synmod).

Usage
-----

See detailed API documentation here_. Here are some examples of how the package may be used:

Analyzing a scikit-learn binary classification model::

    # Train a model
    from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
    from sklearn import datasets
    model = LogisticRegression()
    dataset = datasets.load_breast_cancer()
    X, y, feature_names = (dataset.data, dataset.target, dataset.feature_names)
    model.fit(X, y)

    # Analyze the model
    import anamod
    output_dir = "example_sklearn_classifier"
    model.predict = lambda X: model.predict_proba(X)[:, 1]  # To return a vector of probabilities when model.predict is called
    analyzer = anamod.ModelAnalyzer(model, X, y, feature_names=feature_names, output_dir=output_dir)
    features = analyzer.analyze()

    # Show list of important features sorted in decreasing order of importance score, along with importance score and model coefficient
    from pprint import pprint
    important_features = sorted([feature for feature in features if feature.important], key=lambda feature: feature.importance_score, reverse=True)
    pprint([(feature.name, feature.importance_score, model.coef_[0][feature.idx[0]]) for feature in important_features])

Analyzing a scikit-learn regression model::

    # Train a model
    from sklearn.linear_model import Ridge
    from sklearn import datasets
    model = Ridge(alpha=1e-2)
    dataset = datasets.load_diabetes()
    X, y, feature_names = (dataset.data, dataset.target, dataset.feature_names)
    model.fit(X, y)

    # Analyze the model
    import anamod
    output_dir = "example_sklearn_regressor"
    analyzer = anamod.ModelAnalyzer(model, X, y, feature_names=feature_names, output_dir=output_dir)
    features = analyzer.analyze()

    # Show list of important features sorted in decreasing order of importance score, along with importance score and model coefficient
    from pprint import pprint
    important_features = sorted([feature for feature in features if feature.important], key=lambda feature: feature.importance_score, reverse=True)
    pprint([(feature.name, feature.importance_score, model.coef_[feature.idx[0]]) for feature in important_features])

The outputs can be visualized in other ways as well. To show a table indicating feature importance::

    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(["open", f"{output_dir}/feature_importance.csv"], check=True)

.. image:: https://github.com/cloudbopper/anamod/blob/master/docs/images/sklearn-table.png?raw=true

To visualize the feature importance hierarchy (since no hierarchy is provided in this case, a flat hierarchy is automatically created)::

    subprocess.run(["open", f"{output_dir}/feature_importance_hierarchy.png"], check=True)

.. image:: https://github.com/cloudbopper/anamod/blob/master/docs/images/sklearn-tree.png?raw=true

Analyzing a synthentic model with a hierarchy generated using hierarchical clustering::

    # Generate synthetic data and model
    import synmod
    output_dir = "example_synthetic_non_temporal"
    num_features = 10
    synthesized_features, X, model = synmod.synthesize(output_dir=output_dir, num_instances=100, seed=100,
                                                        num_features=num_features, fraction_relevant_features=0.5,
                                                        synthesis_type="static", model_type="regressor")
    y = model.predict(X, labels=True)

    # Generate hierarchy using hierarchical clustering
    from types import SimpleNamespace
    from anamod.simulation import simulation
    args = SimpleNamespace(hierarchy_type="cluster_from_data", contiguous_node_names=True, num_features=num_features)
    feature_hierarchy, _ = simulation.gen_hierarchy(args, X)

    # Analyze the model
    from anamod import ModelAnalyzer
    analyzer = ModelAnalyzer(model, X, y, feature_hierarchy=feature_hierarchy, output_dir=output_dir)
    features = analyzer.analyze()

    # Visualize feature importance hierarchy
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(["open", f"{output_dir}/feature_importance_hierarchy.png"], check=True)

.. image:: https://github.com/cloudbopper/anamod/blob/master/docs/images/synthetic-tree.png?raw=true

Analyzing a synthetic temporal model::

    # Generate synthetic data and model
    import synmod
    output_dir = "example_synthetic_temporal"
    num_features = 10
    synthesized_features, X, model = synmod.synthesize(output_dir=output_dir, num_instances=100, seed=100,
                                                        num_features=num_features, fraction_relevant_features=0.5,
                                                        synthesis_type="temporal", sequence_length=20, model_type="regressor")
    y = model.predict(X, labels=True)

    # Analyze the model
    from anamod import TemporalModelAnalyzer
    analyzer = TemporalModelAnalyzer(model, X, y, output_dir=output_dir)
    features = analyzer.analyze()

    # Visualize feature importance for temporal windows
    import subprocess
    subprocess.run(["open", f"{output_dir}/feature_importance_windows.png"], check=True)

.. image:: https://github.com/cloudbopper/anamod/blob/master/docs/images/synthetic-windows.png?raw=true

The package supports parallelization using HTCondor_, which can significantly improve running time for large models.
If HTCondor is available on your system, you can enable it by providing the "condor" keyword argument. The python
package ``htcondor`` must be installed (see Installation). Additional condor options may be viewed in the API documentation::

    analyzer = anamod.ModelAnalyzer(model, X, y, condor=True)

.. _here: https://anamod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html
